# Notes

* There are two important types of organization of a distributed system or application they are wrappers and interceptors. 

* They both target different issues, but have the same goal of middleware to achieve openness.

* To achieve ultimate opennes when we can compos middleware at runtime. 

### Wrappers 

* Wrapper (Adapter): A special component that offers an interface acceptalbe to a client application, which function are transformed into those available at the component. This solve the problem on incompatible interfaces. 

* Object Adapter: A component that allows application to invoke remote objects.
