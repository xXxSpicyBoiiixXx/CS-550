# Chapter 02 Notes 

The notes here are broken up into sections on what I deemed most important from the textbook and written in a way that makes sense to me to review for later. Below are terms in this chapter that helped me understand it better.

## Some Vocabulary

* Software Architecture: Logical organziation of a distributed system into software components.

* Architectural Style: Formulated in terms of components. Basically the way they are connected, data exchanged, and finally how they are jointly configured into a system.

* Componenet: A modular unit with well-defined requried interfaces that is replaceable in the envrionment. 

* Connector: A mechanism that mediates communication, coordination, or cooperation with componenets. 

* Layer Fasion: Componenets are organized in layers.

* Downcall: A component at a lower-level layer expect a response.

* Upcall: A component at a high-level layer expect a response. 

* Communication Protocol: The rules that parties will have to follow in order to exchange information.

* Persistent: Even if no application is running, data will be stored somewhere for next use. 

* Object's State: Natural of encapsulating data.

* Object's Methods: Operatins that can be performed on that data.

* Proxy: Cleint binds to a distributed obejct, an implementation of the object's interface.

* Skelton: Server-Side stub.

* Remote Objects: Objects is that their state is not distributed, it resides at a single machine. Only the interfaces implemented by the object are made avaliable on other machiens.
