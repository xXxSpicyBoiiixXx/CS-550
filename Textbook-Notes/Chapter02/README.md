# Chapter 01 Notes 

The notes here are broken up into sections on what I deemed most important from the textbook and written in a way that makes sense to me to review for later. Below are terms in this chapter that helped me understand it better.

## Some Vocabulary

* Plug Computers: Small computers that can be plugged directly into an outlet an offer near-desktop performance.

* Node: A computing element. Can be either hardware device or a software process.

* Open Group: Any node is allowed to join the distributed system. Meaning it can send messages to any node in the system.

* Closed Group: Only the members of that group can communicate with each other, there is a spiecal mechnaism needed to let a node join or leave this type of group. 

* Structured Overlay Network: Each node has a well-definded set of neighbors with who they communicate with. e.g. tree or logical ring.

* Unstructed Overlay Network: Each node has a number of referecnes to randomly selected other nodes. 

* Distribution Transparency: The user should not be able to tell which computer a process is executing, where the data is stored, or anything else. 

* Middleware: Often organized with distributed systems as a separate layer of software placed on top of the operating systems of computers that are in the system.

* Groupware: Software for collaborative editing, teleconferencing, etc.

* Transparent: Invisible to end users and applications.

* Access Transparency: Hiding differences in data representation and the way that objects can be accessed.

* Location Transparency: Users cannot tell where an object is physically located in the system.

* Relocation Transparency: Entire site may have moved from one data cetner to antoher, yet users should not notice. 

* Migration Transparency: When the distributed system supports the mobility of processes and resources initated by users, without affecting ongoing communications and operations.

* Replications Transparency: HIding the fact that there are several copies of a resource exist, or that several processes are operating in some form of lockstep mode so that one can take over when another fails. 

* Concurrency Transparency: Users should not notice each other if they are making use of the same resource. 

* Failure Transparency: A user or application does not notice that some piece of the system fails to work properly, and the system subsequently (and automaticaly) recovers from that failure. 

* Open Distributed System: Essentially a system that offers components that can easily be used by, or integrated into other systems. 

* Interoperabilty: The extent by which two implementations of systems or components form different manufactures can co-exist and work togeher by merely relying on each other's services as specified by a common standard. 

* Portability:
