# Summary 

* We can organize distributed systems in various methods. 

*  There is a distinction between software architecuture and system architecture. 

* Software architecture deals with the logical organization of the software such as how do compoennets interact, in what ways can they be structured, how can they be made independent, etc. 

* System architecutre deal with the components that constitue a distributed system place across t
he various machiens. 

* One way distributed system can be organzied is in a client-server fasion. This is tradition way of modularizing  software in which a module calls the function available in another module.. By doing so we get a natural physical distribution of function across a collection of machines. These arictecutres are generally highly centralized. 

* In decentralized architecures we see an equal role played by process taht constitute a distributed system aka P2P systems.  

* In hybrid architecures, elements from centeralized and decentralized organizations are combined. This is important for BitTorrent-basd systems.
