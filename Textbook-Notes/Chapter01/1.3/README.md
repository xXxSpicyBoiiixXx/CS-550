## Notes 

This chapter deals with various types of distributed systems. There are distinctions between distributed computing systems, distributed informations systems, and pervasive systems. 

### High Perfromance Distirbuted Computing

***Cluster Computing*** consists of the underlying hardware consists of a collection of similar workstations or PCs, closely connected by means of LANs. Also each node is running the same OS. 

***Grid Computing*** consists of being a subgroup of distributed systems that are often constructed as federation of computer systems, which all maybe different within the admin domain, hardware, software, and network technology. 

***Cloud Computing*** consists of have the entire infranstructure outsource for applications. This is essentailly providing dunamical infrasturcture and makes it where what is needed. 

### Cluster Computing 

Cluster computing became popular when the price/performance ratio of personal computers and workstations improved. There is a master node that acts like a middleware for all the slave machines. This shows a problem, as the compute nodes are seen to be highly identical. There is a even more symmetric approach followed in the MOSIX system where it attempts to be a ***single-system image*** of a cluster, where its the ultimate distribution transparency by appearing to be a single computer. In traditonal cluster computing, the computers are largely the same, having the same operating system, all while being on the same netowrk. 

### Grid Computing 
There are no assumpitoins made of the hardware, operating systems, networks, domains,etc. This results in virtual organization. There seems to be architectural issues as different orginzations try and use the same resources.
