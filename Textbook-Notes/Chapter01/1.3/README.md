### High Perfromance Distirbuted Computing

***Cluster Computing*** consists of the underlying hardware consists of a collection of similar workstations or PCs, closely connected by means of LANs. Also each node is running the same OS. 

***Grid Computing*** consists of being a subgroup of distributed systems that are often constructed as federation of computer systems, which all maybe different within the admin domain, hardware, software, and network technology. 

***Cloud Computing*** consists of have the entire infranstructure outsource for applications. This is essentailly providing dunamical infrasturcture and makes it where what is needed.
