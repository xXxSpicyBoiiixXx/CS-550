# Chapter 01 Notes 

The notes here are broken up into sections on what I deemed most important from the textbook and written in a way that makes sense to me to review for later. Below are terms in this chapter that helped me understand it better.

## Some Vocabulary

* Plug Computers: Small computers that can be plugged directly into an outlet an offer near-desktop performance.

* Node: A computing element. Can be either hardware device or a software process.

* Open Group: Any node is allowed to join the distributed system. Meaning it can send messages to any node in the system.

* Closed Group: Only the members of that group can communicate with each other, there is a spiecal mechnaism needed to let a node join or leave this type of group. 

* Structured Overlay Network: Each node has a well-definded set of neighbors with who they communicate with. e.g. tree or logical ring.

* Unstructed Overlay Network: Each node has a number of referecnes to randomly selected other nodes. 

* Distribution Transparency: The user should not be able to tell which computer a process is executing, where the data is stored, or anything else. 

* Middleware: Often organized with distributed systems as a separate layer of software placed on top of the operating systems of computers that are in the system.
