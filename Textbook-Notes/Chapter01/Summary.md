# Summary Chapter 01

Distributed systems consist of autonomous computers that work together to give the apperance of a single coherent system. 

Middleware is a software layer logically placed between operating systems and distrbuted applications. 

Design goals for distributed systems include sharing resources and ensuring openness. 

Distribution Transparenct is never achieved and it also comes at a price of money and performance. 

One design goal that doesn't go with transperency is scalability. Sometimes administrative scalability. 

Lots of assumptions are made, but when they are dropped then it makes it difficult to fix the system. 

Distributed computing systems are deployed for HPCs and sharing of resources. 

THere is a class of distributing systems where the components are small and many. This is more so for pervasive computing enivronments.
