# Chapter 06 Notes - Coordination 

Got tired of typing out the vocabulary and it got tiresome. I just included the vocabulary in section since I need t
o speed up the reading.

* It is important to note that multiple processes do not access resources at the same. So there needs to be coordinations.

* An example is that there must be some coordination of so they need to agree on the ordering of events, e.g. message m1 from process P was sent before or after message m2 from process Q.

* Process Synchronization: Make sure that one process waits for antoher to complete its operation. 

* Data Synchronization: This ensures taht the two sets of data are the same. 

* Coordination: The main goal is to manage the interactions and dependeices between activitys in a DS 

* It is important that a group of processes can appoint one process as a coordinator, which is done by election algorithns.
