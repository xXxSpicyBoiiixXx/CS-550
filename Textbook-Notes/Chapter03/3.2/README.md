# Virtualization 

* Threads and processes can be seen as a way to do more things at the same time. 

* Resource Virtualization: Separation between having a single CPU and being able to pretend there are more can be extended to other resources as well.

### Principle of Virtualization 

* Virtualization deal with extending or replacing an existing interface so as to mimic the behavior of another system 

### Virtualization and Distributed Systems

* Hardware and low-level systems software change fast but software at higher levels of abstraction (middleware and applications) are more stable. So we are dealing with the fact taht the situation that legacy software cannot be maintained in the same pace as the platform it relies on. Hence this is where virtualization comes into play.
