# Programming Assignment 1 

You can compile all the java files as entering 

make 

then you can run the server as 

run_server 

following with this you can run clients as the following

run_clients

from there you will be promted to for registering files with the server or vice verse. I jsut made three simple text files as 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt
The client can act as servers themselves to just give another client a requested document. 

There are logs being held in the server and for the IP I just took my local IP address of 127.0.0.1

The two other files run_test and run_test2 was not working and will break things. Unfortuantly I did not get a graph for perfomance as a result of my test scripts breaking. As well as I could not get the MD5 file to actually hash my files. 

Using parts of this for programming assignment 2 as this is basically the second one lol.
